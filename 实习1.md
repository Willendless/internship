#### container

+ container: light weight operating system virtualization
  + a filesystem of binaries, libraries, and dependencies
  + isolation from other processes and containers
    + resource isolation(*cgroups*)
    + *namespace* isolation
+ host kernel sharing but own system binaries and libraries

---

+ docker
  + features on top of the baisc OS cgroup containers
  + *images*: compressed collection of the libraries, binarries, and applications that make up a container
    + defined by *dockerfile*
      + docker than compresses the environment into a binary
  + docer CLI(command line tool) -(HTTP REST API)-> dockerd(docker daemon, User level management) -(gRPC)-> containerd(high level runtime) -(Exec)-> runc(*low level container runtime*
  + container runtime
    + a library that is responsible for starting and managing containers
      + takes in a root file system for the container and a configuration of the isolation configurations
      + creates the cgroup and sets resource limitations
      + unshare to move to own namespaces
      + sets up the root file system for the cgroup with chroot
      + running commands in the cgroup
    + *runc* by Docker, *rkt* by CoreOS

---

example: creating a container with cgroup

```
$ UUID = $(uuidgen)
$ cgcreate -g cpu,memory:$UUID
$ cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes = 100000000 $UUID
$ cgset -r cpu.cfs_period_us = 1000000 $UUID
$ cgset -r cpu.cfs_quota_us = 2000000 $UUID
$ cgexec -g cpu,memory:$UUID \
> unshare -uinpUrf —mount-proc && \
> sh -c "/bin/hostname $UUID && chroot $ROOTFS $CMD”
```

+ Create the cgroup with cpu and memory
controllers and path = UUID
+ Set resource limitations for
created group
+ Unshare the indicated namespaces
that were inherited from the parent
process, then execute arguments
+ Change the cgroup’s hostname to the
UUID
+ change the cgroup's root to be the subdirectory at new-root, then execute arguments 

#### microservices + the cloud

1. application packed into containers
    + great isolation and resource management
    + dependecies packaged into the container makes them easy to deploy

---

+ Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
  + a service is like an interface
    + only need to know the API
  + contact the sercive through its long lived abstract name and its consistent API
  + complex applications strung together from a collection of services
+ Microservices
  + a form of soa
    + loosely coupled
    + standardized API contract and independent black box implementations
    + long lived hostname to refer to the service
  + cloud native - designed to be run in the modern cloud application
  + implemented by nearly identical replicas
    + microservice load balance to one of possibly many replicas
  + *containerizable*
    + replicas are packaged as containers
    + resource requirements are reasonably definable
  + Independent - services can be independently developed, tested, deployed, and maintained
  + scalability - horizaontally scale any of the microservices depending on specific load

---

+ independent implementations
  + each microservice can be specialized and implemented with the best language, framework, tools for the job
  + architecture is pluggable.
    + third party applications like MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis are all microservices that can be easily integrated into your system
+ business organization
  + Each microservice is independent and can
live in its own repository and be owned by
a dedicated team of engineers
  + decouple - If the implementation changes, other
services do not need to know as long as
API stays consistent
+ complexity
  + Management of service lifecycle (orchestration), tracing bugs between services (distributed tracing), access control, fault tolerance, and more all really hard problems

---

+ the cloud
  + applications split into micro services
  + each service has independent owners and dependecies
  + Services packaged as containers, which provide isolation, reproducibility, and dependency management
  + Containers deployed onto the cloud
+ *cloud computing*: on-demand availabitlity of computer system resources(data storage and computing power)
  1. Software as a Service (SaaS)
  2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

---

+ SaaS:
  + The product is software a company has developed.
  + Hosting and management is taken care of by the provider.
  + Customers interact with it through APIs or webpages
+ PaaS
  + The product is something you can use to build your own applications
  + Operating systems, runtimes, managed databases, web site hosting
  + Hosting and management often taken care of by the provider
+ IaaS
  + The product is the infrastructure you use to deploy your applications
  + Access to CPUs, VMs, block devices, networking, etc
  + You do your own hosting and most management of resources

---

+ IaaS
  + pros
    + availability
    + scalability
    + quolity
    + specilaization
  + cons
    + cost
    + security
    + limited control

---

+ public cloud
+ private cloud

#### container orchestration

+ Applications split into micro services, services packaged as containers, containers deployed onto virtual machines hosted on the cloud
+ *container orchestration*: 
  + In a way, it provides a clean, easy to use abstraction for your physical data center resources => **referee**
  + It manages the sharing of those resources => **illusionist**
    + resource limits, resource requests, container level isolation, private networks
  + It provides common services to the micro services and containers => **Glue**
    + access to shared persistent storage, networking, authorization (RBAC)

---

+ mesos
  + contributions
    + abstract ("virtualize") data center resouces to frameworks
    + make it easier to develop and deploy new frameworks
  + A Mesos slave runs on each machine and reports a vector of the available resources at that machine.
  + A Mesos master coordinates between the slaves its responsible for and the frameworks it's serving.

---

##### k8s

+ nodes: virtual (or physical) machines that Kubernetes can schedule containers onto.
  + node component: run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the kubernetes runtime environment
    + kubelet: agent that runs on each node in the cluster and ensures the containers described in PodSpecs are running and healthy
    + kube-proxy
    + container runtime: docker...
+ pod: smallest unit of execution. A set of one or more containers that is always deployed together and onto the *same* node.
+ control plane: The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers
  + manages the worker nodes and the pods in the cluster
  + usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availabitlity
  + components
    + front end: kube-apiserver
    + etcd: consistent k/v backing store
    + kube-scheduler: watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and assign node
    + kube-controller-manager
      + node controller
      + replication controller
      + endpoints controller
      + service accout & token controllers
    + cloud-controller-manager
