+ 尝试看源码
+ 尝试解决问题
+ *DDA*第二章

## etcd v3 authentication

+ v3使用grpc，v2使用Restful
  + v3使用connection based authentication
  + v2使用per-request authentication

### functionality requirements

+ per connection authentication
+ functionality
  + v3使用扁平的键值空间，v2使用目录结构
+ stronger consistency guarantees than v2 auth

### main required changes

+ dedicated connection per client for authentication before sending authenticated requests
+ add permission information (user ID and authorized revision) to the Raft commands
+ *every request* is permission checked in the state machine layer, rather than API layer?

### permission metadata consistency

+ in v2, each permission check is processed by the etcd member that receives the client request => stale metadata
+ stale permission attack => add permission check logic to the state machine of etcd

### Design and implementation

#### authentication

1. client create a gRPC connection only to authenticate user ID and password
    + return an authentication token
2. throw away previous connection. use new connection for using the token

##### rpc implementation

+ auth mechanism checks passwords in API layer
+ TOCTTOU, client A call `Authenticate()` then B call `ChangePassword()`
+ solution:
  + API layer: *version number validation* based on the revision

##### resolving a token in the API layer

+ `grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials()` associate the token with the newly created connection
+ API layer filled the token information in the head of a raft log entry
  + `etcdserverpb.RequestHeader.Username`
  + `etcdserverpb.RequestHeader.AuthRevision`

##### checking permission in the state machine

+ info in `etcdserverpb.RequestHeader` is checked in the apply phase of the state machine

#### token type

+ simple
+ JWT: stateless => include username and revision metadata => server doesn't need to track token-user correspondence

### permission grant

+ permission granting for a key range => granting a permission of a nonexistent key is possible
+ multiple lookup of the metadata?

## [comparison between etcd and other kv stores](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/learning/why/)

+ concurrency primitives
  + lock rpcs, election rpcs, caommand line locks, command line elections, recipes
+ linearizable read
+ mvcc
+ transactions: read, write, field compares
+ change notification: historical and current key intervals
+ user permission: role based vs. ACL
+ HTTP/JSON API
+ membership reconfiguration
+ maximum reliable database size(several GB)
+ minimum read linearization latency

### zk

+ Dynamic cluster membership reconfiguration
+ Stable read/write under high load
+ A multi-version concurrency control data model
+ Reliable key monitoring which never silently drop events
+ Lease primitives decoupling connections from sessions
+ APIs for safe distributed shared locks
+ use *grpc*/own custom Jute RPC protocol

### usecase

#### metadata

+ limit consensus to a single replication group
+ replication cannot horizontally scale: lacks data sharding vs. newsql use replication groups
+ etcd => strictly assign each modification a global unique and increasing ID
+ etcd => app reasons primarily about metadata or metadata ordering, such as to coordinate processes
+ new sql => need extra coordination step among replication groups

#### distributed coordination

+ built-in distributed coordination primitives support

### API

+ lease作用？
  + detect client liveness
+ role-based authentication是什么
+ range
+ software transactional memory

## 源码

## 比较

+ 分布式文件系统：1亿1M小文件
+ 分布式kv存储: 百万kps
+ 分布式数据库：结构化数据

## 反思

+ 虽然实习上暂时没有什么代码需要实现，但是6.824还是要补完。
+ 数据结构库尽量每天都要补充代码。
