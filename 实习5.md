## etcd文档学习

### data model

#### key-value pair

+ physical data -> persistent b+tree.
+ key: (major, sub, type)
  + major: store revision holding the key
  + sub: differences among keys within the same revision
  + type: optional suffix for special value
+ value:
  + delta: modification from previous revision
+ secondary in-memory btree index:
  + keys: same as b+tree
  + value: pointer to the modification of the persistent b+tree

### client

+ balancer: establish gRPC connections to an etcd cluster
+ API client: sends RPCs to an etcd server
+ error handler: whether to retry a failed request or switch endpoints

---

+ grpc 1.0
  + maintains TCP connections to each endpoint
  + fisrt established endpoint as "pinned address"
+ cons
  + multiple TCP connections => faster balancer failover
  + more resources
  + balancer does not understand node's health status or cluster membership

---

+ grpc 1.7
  + maintain one TCP connection to a chosed etcd server
  + first try to connect to all cluster endpoints, pins the first successfully connected address and closing others
  + error is went to client error handler
    + take an error and decide whether to retry on the same endpoint or to switch to other addresses
    + stream RPCs (Watch and KeepAlive), requested with no timeouts <= periodic HTTP/2 pings to check status <= switch to other endpoints
+ cons
  + ping mechanism still unable to detect network partitions
  + unhealthy endpoints list is false positive
  + grpc interface update

---

+ grpc 1.23
  + per conncection for each endpoint
  + load balancing policy: RR
  + implements retry in the gRPC interceptor chain
+ cons
  + network partition, lack health checking service
  
### learner

#### membership reconfiguration

+ scenarios
    1. new cluster member overloads leader
    2. network partitions scenarios
        + *member add operation:*
            1. apply member add command
            2. starts the new node process
    3. cluster misconfigurations
      + member add command with invalid url, cause the cluster loses quorum => no way to revert the membership change.
+ learner
  + *V3.4*
  + new learner as non-voting member but still receives all data from leader => does not count in quorum
    + when a learner catch up with leader's progress, he can be promoted to a voting member using `member promote` API
      + *Only after its log has caught up to leader’s can learner be promoted to a voting member*
      + learner cannot process read/write
      + limits the total number of learners

#### etcd的主要业务场景

+ 注册中心
  + 全局元数据的存储
+ 配置中心
  + 修改某个配置，动态处理
  + 分布式配置，动态配置服务
  + 可以基于watch的API基于不同应用做动态配置。

### 一些问题

1. etcd如何查看监控它的各项指标？
2. 集群中新增和获取数据的传播路径，单个机器下线新增一台机器的时候内部是符合处理的？
3. etcd如何做双活？
4. etcd如何数据迁移？
5. etcd做注册中心如何做的？
6. 单继和集群模式如何搭建，核心参数有哪些？
7. etcd单机及集群下的性能指标？
8. 能否支持多语言接入？
9. 对比zookeeper的优缺点？
10. 用etcd做配置中心与apollo和nacos对比有哪些有点?
